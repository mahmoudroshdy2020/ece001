ntelligent robots and artificial beings first appeared in the ancient Greek myths of Antiquity. Aristotle's development of the syllogism and it's use of deductive reasoning was a key moment in mankind's quest to understand its own intelligence. While the roots are long and deep, the history of artificial intelligence as we think of it today spans less than a century. The following is a quick look at some of the most important events in AI.

  <tr>
    <td>1949</td>
    <td>In his book The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory, Donald Hebb proposes the theory that neural pathways are created from experiences and that connections between neurons become stronger the more frequently they're used. Hebbian learning continues to be an important model in AI.</td>

Claude Shannon publishes the paper "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess."
Isaac Asimov publishes the "Three Laws of Robotics."  </td>

<tr>
    <td>1956</td>
    <td>The phrase artificial intelligence is coined at the "Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence." Led by John McCarthy, the conference, which defined the scope and goals of AI, is widely considered to be the birth of artificial intelligence as we know it today. 
Allen Newell and Herbert Simon demonstrate Logic Theorist (LT), the first reasoning program.

    <td>Frustration with the progress of AI development leads to major DARPA cutbacks in academic grants. Combined with the earlier ALPAC report and the previous year's "Lighthill Report," artificial intelligence funding dries up and research stalls. This period is known as the "First AI Winter." </td>

  <tr>
    <td>1987-1993</td>
    <td>As computing technology improved, cheaper alternatives emerged and the Lisp machine market collapsed in 1987, ushering in the "Second AI Winter." During this period, expert systems proved too expensive to maintain and update, eventually falling out of favor.
Japan terminates the FGCS project in 1992, citing failure in meeting the ambitious goals outlined a decade earlier.
DARPA ends the Strategic Computing Initiative in 1993 after spending nearly $1 billion and falling far short of expectations.  </td>
